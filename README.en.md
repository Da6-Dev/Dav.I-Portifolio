## üöÄ About The Project

This project is the second version of my personal portfolio, rebuilt from scratch to be a robust and scalable platform that reflects my skills in modern web development. The main goal is to have a central hub that updates automatically as I develop new projects, without needing to change the portfolio's code.

<br>

## ‚ú® Key Features

This portfolio was built with a set of features designed for user experience and to demonstrate technical skills:

* **üé® Responsive Design:** A fully adaptive interface, with a sidebar navigation on desktop and a bottom navigation bar on mobile for an optimized experience.
* **üåó Light & Dark Theme:** A theme switcher that persists the user's choice in the browser's `localStorage`.
* **üåç Multilingual Support (i18n):** The site's content is available in Portuguese and English, with automatic browser language detection and a manual switcher.
* **üîó Dynamic Projects from GitHub:** The projects section consumes the GitHub API in real-time. To add a new project, you just need to:
    1.  Add the `portfolio` topic to the repository.
    2.  Include a `cover.png` image.
    3.  (Optional) Add a `description.json` file for multilingual descriptions.
* **üìÑ Project Detail Pages:** Each project has a dedicated detail page that fetches and renders its `README.md`, allowing for an in-depth presentation.
* **üìä Real-time Counters with Firebase:**
    * **Unique View Counter:** Registers each new visitor (once per browser).
    * **Like Counter:** An interactive button on the homepage for visitors to show their appreciation.
    * Data is stored and updated in real-time with Firestore.
* **üè∑Ô∏è Dynamic Page Titles:** The browser tab title is dynamically updated for each page, improving UX and SEO.
